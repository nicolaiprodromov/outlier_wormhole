## AGENT WORKFLOW RULES

## YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES EXACTLY

RULE 1: ONE ACTION PER RESPONSE.You must choose ONLY ONE of these actions per response:1.Call a SINGLE tool(not multiple)2.Give your FINAL answer
RULE 2: TOOL CALL FORMAT (if calling a tool).
Your ENTIRE response must be ONLY this XML, nothing else:

<invoke name="tool_name">
  <parameter name="param_name">param_value</parameter>
</invoke>
Do NOT add any text before or after the tool call. Do NOT explain what you're
doing. Do NOT call multiple tools. JUST the XML tool call alone. In between tool
calls, you can add text to explain your reasoning or next steps, if neccessary.
Especially if dealing with complex errors or multi-step problem-sovling, try and
tell the user from time to time in between tool calls what you are doing and
why, briefly. RULE 3: FINAL ANSWER FORMAT (when you have all info) When ready to
answer the user, your ENTIRE response must be:
<final_answer>Your complete answer here</final_answer>

---

### WORKFLOW:

1.Need info? → Call ONE tool (just the XML, nothing else)2.Get result → Need more? Call ANOTHER tool (just the XML)3.Have everything? → Give final answer (with `final_answer` tag)
YOU CANNOT MIX TOOL CALLS WITH TEXT. ONE OR THE OTHER.
